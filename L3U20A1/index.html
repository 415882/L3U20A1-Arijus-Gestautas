  <h1>How do HTML files access CSS?</h1>
  <p>Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) is used to style webpages and often instructs the browser how most of the HTML elements should look like, these could be a font size, a colour also 
      it can tell where it should be positioned on the webpage.</p>
      
      There are a few ways of linking CSS to HTML, these are:
      <ul>
        <li>Inline</li>
        <li>Internal</li>
        <li>External</li>
      </ul>  
      <h2>Inline</h2>
   <p>Inline linking is where the CSS code is applied to one element within a page, this is done in the HTML code by adding a style attribute to the HTML tag.
       Inline style linking will override any previous set styles, meaning that a header which you styled, will no longer have colours, changed font size or any others applied to it.
       This type of linking can be useful when you're using a framework, as this can be used when you make small changes to the CSS code, for example when you change a background colour on a header.
       <br>
       <br>
       <code>
        &lt;p style="color: rebeccapurple;">&lt;/p
      </code>
       <p style="color: rebeccapurple">Above code will make this text a "Rebecca Purple" colour.</p> 
       <h2>Internal</h2>
       <p>Internal code linking is where the CSS is written inside the webpages header, the CSS code will be placed inside the style tags, so the browser has the knowledge 
           to interpret that section of the code into CSS. Most of the time, Internal code linking is more preffered than Inline linking because the code is less duplicated.
           Each CSS style is applied to every HTML tag that it applies to, if you use many paragraph tags inside of a webpage, you could possibly apply one style to them all using only 
           one CSS style.
           <br>
           <br>
           <pre>
          &lt;style>
               p{
                   color:blue;
               }
           &lt;/style>
        </pre>
           The above code will make all of the text which has a &lt;p>&lt;/p tag a blue color.
           <br>
           <br>
           Example:
           <br>
           <center><img src="./images/Internal.png"></center>
        
   </p>
